# **YouTube Data Harvesting and Warhousing**


* This project aims to harvest data from YouTube using Python scripting and store it in a NoSQL (MongoDB) database as a data lake. 

* The harvested data can then be fetched from the NoSQL database and migrated to a SQL (PostgreSQL) database for further analysis. Additionally, SQL queries can be executed on the postgreSQL database to answer specific questions related to the uploaded channel information.

**Prerequisites Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:**

***Python 3.9 or later***

***MongoDB***

***PostgreSQL***
